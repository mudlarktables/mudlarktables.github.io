Hi! Yes, this is a real website. I learned to write HTML in the 1990's. I tried some of the popular website creation tools, and nothing was as easy or free as I wanted. They all make fancy-generic bleh with code that I can't look at and immediately understand. But I defintely <i>do</i> need a website, so I'm typing this up in Notepad like me and my friends used to do in 1998.
